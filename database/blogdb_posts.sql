A three-stripe black, white and papaya colour scheme symbolises the Woking team&rsquo;s Triple Crown victories: the 1974 Indy 500 with the M16C, the 1995 Le Mans 24 Hours with the F1 GTR, and the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix with the MP4/2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri will be hoping that this striking livery will bring some much-needed performance to the MCL60, and perhaps even add to McLaren&rsquo;s Triple Crown history. The team has won at Monaco on 15 occasions, the most of any team in F1 with a list of drivers including Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna, Mika H&auml;kkinen, Kimi R&auml;ikk&ouml;nen and Lewis Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on this special livery, Zak Brown, CEO, McLaren Racing, said: &ldquo;Having achieved the greatest accomplishment in motorsport by completing the Triple Crown, we are proud to celebrate the rich history of McLaren Racing with a special livery at the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;In line with our 60th anniversary celebrations and honouring the legacy of Bruce McLaren, the unique livery pays homage to the three victories which form the Triple Crown accolade.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Monaco Grand Prix takes place this weekend.

At least eight teams had to support the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, despite promising feedback from testing, in a vote taken during the Monaco GP weekend, a majority opted not to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Usually we have some races with rain, like Suzuka, for example,&quot;&amp;nbsp;Isola told Motorsport.com. &quot;And it was a good opportunity to test them before the end of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The problem is that to test them as an additional prototype is difficult because we should send them everywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was talking to the FIA, offering the intermediate for Singapore, and then they came back to me saying no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The teams didn&#039;t agree. Unfortunately, we had more than two teams against, because we needed eight teams in favour.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isola insisted that he didn&#039;t know why teams would reject the new intermediates having accepted the full wets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&#039;s a good question.

We have prepared for the race in the simulator and will work on the details in free practice. We will have to be able to find a good balance between downforce and straight-line speed. We arrive on top of the standings, and I am confident we will still be there at the end of the six hours&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;. With Daniel Serra and Miguel Molina in second place, the second AF Corse car is also gunning for victory to close the 14-point gap to the top. The pair in car #52 have two podium finishes to their name in the first two races of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LMGTE Am. &lt;/strong&gt;After celebrating their first win in the FIA WEC, Roberto Lacorte, Giorgio Sernagiotto, and Antonio Fuoco will defend Cetilar Racing&rsquo;s top spot in the LMGTE Am standings from the assaults of AF Corse 488 GTE #54, crewed by Thomas Flohr, Giancarlo Fisichella and Francesco Castellacci. With third place in the Algarve, the Italo-Swiss crew was back on the podium after finishing runners-up at the 2019 edition of the 1000 Miles of Sebring. The Piacenza-based team will field two more cars at Monza. The first, car #83, will be driven by Fran&ccedil;ois Perrodo, Nicklas Nielsen and Alessio Rovera, winners of the opening round at Spa-Francorchamps. Christoph Ulrich, Simon Mann and Toni Vilander will take the hot seat of the second, car #61. On the theme of seasonal debuts in the WEC, we should mention the Ferraris of Rinaldi Racing and Inception Racing. The German and British teams will use the Monza event to prepare for the upcoming 24 Hours of Le Mans. The former will deploy Pierre Ehret, Christian Hook and Jeroen Bleekemolen, while Brendan Iribe, Ollie Millroy and Ben Barnicoat will debut in the 488 GTE #71. Again, Iron Lynx will field two cars, with a change in the &ldquo;Iron Dames&rdquo; line-up: Sarah Bovy from Belgium will replace Manuela Gostner alongside Michelle Gatting and Rahel Frey, while the crew of #60 remains unchanged, with Claudio Schiavoni, Andrea Piccini and Matteo Cressoni.&lt;/p&gt;',1,'2023-06-20 19:35:01',3),(14,39,'Quartararo: Yamaha “losing its strong points every year” at Jerez in MotoGP','1687282526_motogp.jpg','&lt;p&gt;The Frenchman scored his first MotoGP pole at Jerez in 2019 as a rookie and took his first win at the track in 2020, was on course to do the same in 2021 before arm pump problems struck him, and was second in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autosport.com/motogp/news/motogp-spanish-gp-espargaro-tops-fp2-bagnaia-and-quartararo-into-q1/10461825/&quot;&gt;end of Friday&rsquo;s running at the Spanish GP&lt;/a&gt;, Quartararo was only 15th on the combined order and will have to face a volatile Q1 session in qualifying that features world champion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autosport.com/driver/francesco-bagnaia/841494/&quot;&gt;Francesco Bagnaia&lt;/a&gt;, standings leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autosport.com/driver/marco-bezzecchi/841477/&quot;&gt;Marco Bezzecchi&lt;/a&gt; and Americas GP winner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autosport.com/driver/alex-rins/841460/&quot;&gt;Alex Rins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quartararo says he didn&rsquo;t know &ldquo;if I was going to finish&rdquo; every time he went into a corner on the M1 on Friday at Jerez and feels like the bike is too aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to say what is wrong, but everything, the feeling we had today on the bike, every time I was going into a corner I didn&rsquo;t know if I was going to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;And the last lap I was improving, but feeling already every time on the limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;But the last lap [I said] &lsquo;whatever happens, happens&rsquo;, and in the last bit I went wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The problem is we don&rsquo;t know why the bike is slow.

It&rsquo;s many other things, and one of them is the corner speed we are getting is not good and the bike is super aggressive &ndash; not because we are going so fast and it&rsquo;s aggressive.
